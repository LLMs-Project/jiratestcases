Feature: Gas contract estimation
Background:
  Given I have a gas contract
  And it has two valid meter reads with thermal properties
  And EE gpke.degreeDaysPlus.value = 0

Scenario Outline: Estimate third meter read with different degreeDaysPlus value
  Given I let the system estimate a third meter read
  And the outcome can be validated positively with the Excel attached
  When I set EE gpke.degreeDaysPlus.value = <value>
  And I let the system estimate the third meter read again
  Then the results differ by the value <value>

Examples:
  | value |
  | 10    |
  | -5    |
  | 20    |
