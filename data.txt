GIVEN I have a gas contract
AND it has two valid meter reads with thermal properties
AND EE gpke.degreeDaysPlus.value = 0
AND I let the system estimate a third meter read
AND the outcome can be validated positively with the Excel attached
WHEN I set EE gpke.degreeDaysPlus.value = X (other than 0)
AND I let the system estimate the third meter read again
THEN the results differ by the value X
